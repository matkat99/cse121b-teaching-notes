      <h2>AJAX: asynchronous requests</h2>
      <p>
        AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript And Xml. It is a collection of
        technologies that allow a webpage to make a request to a server after it
        has loaded for additional information. The requests are Asynchronous in
        that the program the made them does not wait around doing nothing until
        they come back...it will move on and do more stuff, the requests are
        made with Javascript, but they don't often return XML anymore. Most
        often now you will get the information back as JSON.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally the requests were made using <code>XmlHttpRequest</code>, and
        you will still see that around, but more and more developers are turning
        to the newer <code>fetch</code> command to make their requests.
      </p>
      <h2>Promises</h2>
      <p>
        The asynchronous nature of these requests is a blessing and a curse. A
        blessing because the developer has no control over how quickly or slowly
        the server responds. So if the request was made synchronously nothing
        else could happen until the request finished. If the server you are
        waiting for is slow, it will make your application slow...not good. So
        asynchronous requests allow our code to interact with external sources
        while still being performant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Asynchronous programming is a bit different to work with however. You
        have to deal with the fact that your code might not run in the order you
        wrote it. This is the curse. There are two main ways for dealing with
        this. One we have talked about before...callback functions. They have
        been used for a while now, but often lead to code that is really hard to
        follow...<a href="http://callbackhell.com" target="_blank"
          >callback hell</a
        >
        is what it is often called.
      </p>
      <p>
        The newer method for writing asynchronous code is <kbd>Promises</kbd>.
        Promises essentially give us another way to say "when you finish your
        thing...<code>then</code> do this next thing". The best way to
        understand them is by seeing them in practice. Luckily for us
        <code>fetch</code> uses promises.
      </p>
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        We will use <code>fetch</code> to pull some data from a remote API
        (application programming interface). An API is essentially what happens
        when an organization decides to expose part of a program they own to the
        world. Why would they do this? Well let's take Calendly for example. It
        is an online scheduling application. A student can go sign up for an
        appointment with their instructor easily with it. The University uses
        Microsoft Exchange for calendaring. If something doesn't show up
        there...I will miss it. Luckily Exchange has an API. Through this API
        Calendly can log into my Exchange account and add things directly to my
        calendar if I give it permission to.
      </p>
      <p>
        So as soon as a student signs up for an appointment in Calendly, the
        appointment automatically gets added to my calendar. This is one example
        of when an API is very useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are going to use a fairly simple free API called
        <a href="https://pokeapi.co" target="_blank">pokeapi</a>. If you visit
        that website you will find the documentation on how to request data, and
        examples. Let's use the example it has to pull information about the
        Pokemon Ditto.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="lang-js">
const url = 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto';
const results = fetch(url);
console.log(results);
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        There is a lot going on in that simple line of code. With it we made a
        request for some specific information from a remote server. Check the
        console and you will find however that we did not get the information
        yet. Just as was mentioned above <code>fetch</code> returns a Promise.
        We have to tell it what we want it to do once the promise
        <kbd>fulfills</kbd> or finishes what it is doing. We do that with the
        <code>.then()</code> method.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="lang-js">
  promise.then(onFulfilled[, onRejected]);

  promise.then(value => {
    // fulfillment
  }, reason => {
    // rejection
  });
</code></pre>
      <p>
        <code>.then()</code> takes two parameters...one required that contains
        what should happen if the request was successful, and one optional that
        contains what should happen if the request fails.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>fetch</code> does not return usable data initially. Instead we
        have to tell it what we were expecting...and ask it to convert the
        response into the right kind of data. The three types it understands are
        <kbd>json()</kbd>, <kbd>text()</kbd> (HTML and XML would be considered
        text), and <kbd>blob()</kbd> (blob is anything that isn't text or json).
        We are expecting JSON back from the api we made the request to. So we
        should convert it to that.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="lang-js line-numbers">
const url = "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto";
let results = null;
// takes a fetch response and checks to make sure it was OK.
// then returns the body of the response as a PROMISE to some JSON.
function convertToJson(response) {
  if (response.ok) {
    return response.json();
  } else {
    console.log("error:", response);
  }
}
// this is where we would do whatever we needed to do with the resulting data.
function doStuff(data) {
  results = data;
  console.log("first: ", results);
}

// read this as: make a request to URL, WHEN it finishes THEN run convertToJson
// WHEN it finishes THEN run doStuff
fetch(url).then(convertToJson).then(doStuff);
// meanwhile...continue with the rest of the program...
console.log("second: ", results);
</code></pre>

      <p>
        Note that the second console.log ran first...then the first one.
        Remember that in async programming Javascript does not wait for
        everything to finish before moving on. If we had tried to use
        <code>results</code> immediately it would have failed. Instead we do
        whatever we need to do with <code>results</code> in the callback that
        gets called by <code>.then()</code>.
      </p>
      <div class="callout">
        <p>
          Note that this would often be done with anonymous functions...without
          the comments and condensed the code above could look like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-js line-numbers">const url = 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto';
let results = null;
fetch(url)
.then((response) => {
  if (response.ok) {
    return response.json();
  } else {
    console.log("error:", response);
  }
})
.then((data) => {
  results = data;
  console.log("first: ", results);
});
console.log('second: ', results);
      </code></pre>
        <p>
          In english I would read that code as: "Make a request to the URL, when
          it finishes THEN take the response, convert it to JSON and return it;
          when that finishes THEN set the results variable equal to the JSON
          data, and log results out".
        </p>

          // .json() also returns a promise...so we have to tell it what to do with another .then()
          results = data;
